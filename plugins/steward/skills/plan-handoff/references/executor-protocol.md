## Executor protocol

1. Before editing, read the current plan and task revisions, actual dependency
   outputs, worktree status, and relevant code, then run the card's entry check.
   Run entry checks and validation commands exactly as written, and read each
   exit code from the command result instead of appending `echo $?` or other
   commands. Stop and hand back with the evidence when the check fails or when
   the task's allowed paths or listed code facts changed beyond the recorded
   baseline, accepted dependency outputs, and this task's own recorded
   checkpoint diff. Changes elsewhere need no action. Preserve existing changes;
   if their source cannot be distinguished, hand back, and never overwrite or
   reset them. A permitted adjustment must be named in the task card; “keep it
   equivalent” is not permission to redesign.
2. Start new work only from `ready`, with dependencies and authorization checked.
   If the card delegates readiness checks, the executor may mark a settled
   `draft` task `ready` after recording evidence that every listed prerequisite
   holds; unresolved design choices still go to the planner. After step 1,
   resume an interrupted `active` task without resetting its status. For a
   `blocked` task, record evidence that the blocker was resolved within the
   contract and existing authority, then return to `ready` if unstarted or
   `active` if resuming. Design, acceptance, or drift blockers remain with the
   planner. Status changes do not authorize contract changes.
   Choose only the listed local details. Do not change requirements,
   architecture, acceptance, or the planner-owned contract. Record work in the
   result area, and also update the task's status where the plan records it,
   such as its status field or heading, to `active`, `blocked`, or `done` as
   observed.
3. Run the specified validation and record each command with its exit code and
   output. Fix and rerun in-contract defects; restore the environment within
   existing authority; adjust commands only inside an explicitly allowed binding
   range. Do not ignore failures or lower pass criteria. Stop, record the
   attempts, and report the handback or escalation the card names when a change
   outside the allowed paths or fixed implementation seems necessary, a failure
   is not an in-contract defect (an environment problem outside existing
   authority, a command binding, a plan or design error, a requirement gap, or a
   pre-existing failure), or the attempt budget is spent.
4. Handback states the disproven assumption, observation and source, affected
   task and acceptance, attempts and results, and decision needed. The executor
   cannot edit the contract to accept its own work.
5. After interruption, record the last validation actually run and its result,
   unfinished diff, current code state, and next action. On resumption repeat
   step 1. Mark `done` only with the stated evidence. After the final
   integration task is `done`, hand its evidence to the acceptance owner; only
   an accepting record completes the overall request.
